## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to search for cocktails by …

- specific name
- ingredient or multiple ingredients
- newest cocktails added
- random cocktails to try
- alcoholic versus non-alcoholic

As a user, I want to be able to…

- save drinks I want to try / have tried to my profile
- edit ingredients and measuring and instructions on how to make
- make notes about the drink itself (“have tried/not tried yet” option? “Favorite/Not Favorite”? )

## Challenges

## What We Would Like To Revisit

*** 

### Thoughts from looking at "Highball" app:

“About”: should be minimal - more about the company than how to use the app. The use of the app should be intuitive enough the user can figure it out without instructions. 

### Possible "About" page copy: 

“[App Name] is a full CRUD app created by Mae We Serve You - a small collective of software engineering students at General Assembly in the 2020 “Mae” cohort.
