Possible App Names:
“Cocktails”
“High Top”
“Mixology”/“Mixologist”
“Elixir”

## Concept

A working full-stack application using the MERN stack that allows users to search for cocktail recipes from an external API, as well as submit and edit their own recipes to the community database.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js
- JSX

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to search for cocktails by …

- specific name
- ingredient or multiple ingredients
- newest cocktails added
- random cocktails to try
- alcoholic versus non-alcoholic

As a user, I want to be able to…

- save drinks I want to try / have tried to my profile
- edit ingredients and measuring and instructions on how to make
- make notes about the drink itself (“have tried/not tried yet” option? “Favorite/Not Favorite”? )

## Challenges

- We discovered the API we chose was somewhat limiting after we got underway. For example, we were able to create separate searches by specific drink name or ingredient, or alcholic or non-alcoholic, but was unable to combine everything into one search. We also found ourselves unable to directly transfer search results from the API into our own database.

## What We Would Like To Revisit

- We would like to come back and add user authentication. We didn't feel comfortable tackling that in the time left after we achieved our other goals.

### Thoughts from looking at "Highball" app:

“About”: should be minimal - more about the company than how to use the app. The use of the app should be intuitive enough the user can figure it out without instructions. 

### Possible "About" page copy: 

“[App Name] is a full MERN CRUD app created by Mae We Serve You - a collective of software engineering students at General Assembly in the 2020 “Mae” cohort.
