### Thoughts from looking at "Highball" app:

“About”: should be minimal - more about the company than how to use the app. The use of the app should be intuitive enough the user can figure it out without instructions. 

### Possible "About" page copy: 

“[App Name] is a full CRUD app created by Mae We Serve You - a small collective of software engineering students at General Assembly in the 2020 “Mae” cohort.
